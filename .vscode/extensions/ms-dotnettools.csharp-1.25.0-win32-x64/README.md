## C# for Visual Studio Code (powered by OmniSharp)

Welcome to the C# extension for Visual Studio Code! This extension provides the following features inside VS Code:

* Lightweight development tools for [.NET Core](https://dotnet.github.io).
* Great C# editing support, including Syntax Highlighting, IntelliSense, Go to Definition, Find All References, etc.
* Debugging support for .NET Core (CoreCLR). NOTE: Mono debugging is not supported. Desktop CLR debugging has [limited support](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/wiki/Desktop-.NET-Framework).
* Support for project.json and csproj projects on Windows, macOS and Linux.

The C# extension is powered by [OmniSharp](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn).

## Announcements

### The C# extension no longer ships with an included Mono & MSBuild Tools

.NET Framework builds of OmniSharp no longer ship with Mono or the MSBuild tooling (See announcement [omnisharp-roslyn#2339](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/2339)). To ensure that the C# extension remains usable out of the box for .NET SDK projects, we have changed the default value of `omnisharp.useModernNet` to `true`.

If you still need Unity or .NET Framework support, you can set `omnisharp.useModernNet` to `false` in your VS Code settings and restart OmniSharp.

See issue [#5120](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/5120) for more details.
